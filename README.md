# Library
> A book tracking page that uses local storage to keep track of a list of books that are entered in a form (includes Javascript form validation). Some details (rating, status, etc.) can be changed after the book appears on the list. Books can also be removed from the list by hovering over them and clicking the trash can that appears. This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum.
